## Project Overview

Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical image analysis. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to automatically classify MRI scans as tumor or non-tumor.
- 🔍 Input: MRI brain scan images
- 📈 Output: Classification label (Tumor / No Tumor)
- 🧠 Model: Custom CNN or pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16)
- 🧪 Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC,
