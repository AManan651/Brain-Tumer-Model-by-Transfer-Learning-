# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection Using Transfer Learning

Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project! This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for detecting brain tumors from MRI images. The goal of this project is to assist medical professionals in early and accurate tumor diagnosis using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.
## Project Overview

Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical image analysis. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to automatically classify MRI scans as tumor or non-tumor.
- 🔍 Input: MRI brain scan images
- 📈 Output: Classification label (Tumor / No Tumor)
- 🧠 Model: Custom CNN or pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16)
- 🧪 Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC,
## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** for data handling and visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model evaluation
